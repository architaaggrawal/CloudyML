------  list paintings that are priced higher than the average

SELECT name, listed_price

WHERE listed_price > (

Our subquery is in the WHERE clause, where it filters the result set based on the listed price. This subquery returns a single value: the average price per painting for our gallery. Each listed price is compared to this value, and only the paintings that are priced above average make it to the final output:

WHERE id IN (
